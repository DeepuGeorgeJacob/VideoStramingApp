# Video Player App with ExoPlayer (Compose & Kotlin)

This is a simple **video player** application demonstrating video playback, content stitching by using **ExoPlayer**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Kotlin**. The app supports both local and streaming content and progress tracking. It also uses a **SharedFlow** to trigger a one-time event, such as displaying a **Toast** message when a specific event occurs.

## Features

- **Video Playback**:
    - Supports playing both **local** and **streaming** videos using **ExoPlayer**, But now configured only for streaming conents.
    - Basic playback controls (play/pause).
- **Content Stitching**:
    - Simulates ad insertion during playback:
        - Main content video plays.
        - At a predetermined timestamp (e.g., 30 seconds), an **ad video** is inserted.
        - After the ad finishes, the main content video resumes.
- **Toast Notifications**:
    - Uses **SharedFlow** to trigger a **Toast** message after the ad is played.
- **Streaming Content**:
    - Supports both local files (e.g., MP4) and streaming URLs.
- **Progress Tracking**:
    - Displays the current playback progress and allows tracking of video position.
- **Multi Module Application**
    - Android application for better maintainability, modularity, and scalability. The modules are organized based on functionality, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.


### Future Improvements (If Time Permits)
1. **Ad Skipping:** Allow users to skip the advertisement after a set period or when a button is pressed.
2. **Custom Playlist:** Let users create and save their own playlists, including the ability to reorder videos.
3. **Advanced Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling for scenarios like network errors or unsupported video formats.
4. **Player Controls:** Enhance player controls by adding features such as volume control, skip forward/backward buttons, and playback speed adjustments.
